    "The team decided to use sentiment analysis on user input. We were aware of what sentiment analysis was, but we are new to NPL and our first attempt at implementing in python. I went and looked up more information about NLP from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis Some things I didn't expect were \"Emoji Sentiment Ranking\" which makes sense but I would not have thought of it without reading about it\n",

To compensate I tried to deploy using binder for the first time. My strategy to share is to fork our main repo, https://github.com/anooj-shah/localhack, and then submit pull requests. This notebook was uploaded to binder for easier integration.\n",
