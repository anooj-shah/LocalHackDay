52:02.0,My wife and I lived on the west coast and I had to leave my job (internship expired). We were running shorter and shorter on cash and were forced to break out our credit card to stay afloat for a while. We used it for rent a few times (big no-no) and for lots of other things. We were both miserable out there so we moved to the midwest in June of 2018. By the time the move was over we had about 4k racked up on the card. We both found good jobs after our move and I wanted this debt gone. This morning I made my last payment of 400 dollars and we now have a 0 balance on the card! Now we can actually start putting some money away!,,

52:02.0,I’ve tried applying it daily on my lashes for 2 weeks and noticed such DRAMATIC difference. My lashes were much much longer and thicker. However as soon as I stopped applying it every day my lashes started falling out more than usual (3-4 per day as opposed to 1-2 per day). The shedding lasted for a few days then it went back to normal. It has been a few months now since I stopped and my lashes are now back at their normal length/density.,,

I am not the best with stats took one class in college and most of what I know comes from excel anyways so I am not exactly sure how to approach this. My thoughts are that I want to get the Variation for my ""missed by"" column then get the Standard Deviation of the Variation then get the Mean missed by.
