        <p>Singin' in the Rain is a 1952 American musical-romantic comedy film. It offers a lighthearted depiction of Hollywood in the late 1920s, with the three stars portraying performers caught up in the transition from silent films to "talkies".
            The film was only a modest hit when first released. However, it has since been accorded legendary status by contemporary critics, and is frequently regarded as the best film musical ever made. Hence the song "Singin' in the Rain" has
            become a
            musical classic in film time. It has even been featured in numerous films such as "The Hollywood Revue of 1929." Overall the song became iconic and reached new heights in the film indusrty due to the mega hit the film itself became.
