            <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction and Motivation</h2>
            <p>Mental Health has been affecting over 450 million people worldwide. Over the recent years, awareness of mental health issues have been growing, and the stigma associated with discussing mental health issues is beginning to fade away. This issue is finally getting some light. Allowing more research to happen in this field.
              </p>
            <p>At the MLH local hack day hackathon, my group and I chose to build something in this field because we feel that we would be impacting approximately one fourth of the world population, and many people in the room. </p>
              <p>Before I get started, I would like to thank my hardworking team; it is amazing to see what we could do in 12 hours. <br><br>Meet the Team:
                  <br>
                  - Anooj <br>
                  - Lucas <br>
                  - Jennifer <br>
                  - Kari </p></p>
              
            <p>My team decided to use sentiment analysis to analyze user input. We used twilio's API to be able to send text messages to a bot who asked to share your feelings. We then sent this data (timestamps and text messages) to a python package called TextBlog (a tool for Natural Language Processing). With this, a sentiment score (polarity) was calcualted. We used matplotlib to plot this data live and showed the various plots on a webpage.
                  <br>
                  Webpage for data visualization: https://anooj-shah.github.io/localhack/ <br>
                The resources we used include the following
                <br>
                - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis<br>
                - https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/quickstart.html#quickstart<br>
                - https://planspace.org/20150607-textblob_sentiment/<br>
                - https://www.lexalytics.com/technology/sentiment<br></p>

            <p>The Project and the Plan<br>
                Our team wanted to develop a mental health application. In this step I am reading a csv of timestamps and text as a list. This information is being passed through TextBlob to run sentiment analysis. The output is written to a CSV for processing by data visualization team.
                <br>
                
              <p>A quick explanation of TextBlob from https://planspace.org/20150607-textblob_sentiment/ <br>
                  Each word in the lexicon has scores for:<br>
                  
                  polarity: negative vs. positive (-1.0 => +1.0)<br>
                  subjectivity: objective vs. subjective (+0.0 => +1.0)<br></p>
                  <h2 class="section-heading">Sentiment Analysis with Python Notebook</h2>



            <p>In the planning stages, we decided that we would generate a CSV of two columns, time stamp and user input string. We generated a dummy_input.csv for testing using various random news articles and Reddit posts. We also used pop songs as quality control. In this step we read the CSV input and parsed it to the TextBlob library.</p>
            <p>This is an example of how the data is being processed:<br>

              <p>Output:</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion:</h2>
                <p>My team and I have surely not solved the issue of mental health, but we believe this solution has room for improvement as well. One area of consideration is training the TextBlog to catch certain edge cases from learning speech patterns from person to person. For example, if a person uses negative words on a daily basis repeatedly, this most likely means that this person just uses this word a lot and may show no indication of a negative sentiment score.  </p>

            <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>


            <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>
