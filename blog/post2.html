            <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction:</h2>
            <p>
              I intern at Celebal Technolgies under the direction of my mentor, Anupam Gupta, President. My project is called Smart Pollution Buddy. 
              Air pollution is a major detriment to society and all future generations to come. It has changed our world and life from ever being the same as before. Many die from air pollution annually. It is a problem that must be prioritized. In order to slow down or even reverse the trend of air pollution so that future generations can see the same planet earth as us, we must monitor air pollution in ways never done before to point out the root of the problem. To battle this issue, I am introducing a smart city approach to fight the first step to cure this problem – monitoring. I will create a device that measures air pollution and shows the data in a way that plots the intensity of air pollution based on location. I hope this can create a map of the intensities of air pollution and can thus help fight the problem from the source. This device, at a large scale, will be able monitor air pollution and detect highly polluted areas which can then be analyzed to find the source of what is causing these areas to be highly polluted. This can be done through predictive analysis. After targeting the cause or source, efforts can be made to eliminate or reduce this cause.  
              I will be gathering my information through global databases that have preserved this data of air pollution in specific countries. I will also be using open source libraries to aid me in the building process of this device. 
              </p>
              <h2 class="section-heading">STEP 1 – RESEARCH AND LEARNING:</h2>
              <p>Air pollution is something we are all affected by. Many believe it is a tragedy we must face with advancements in technology. The world is not the same as what it used to be, and it will continue to not be the same for future generations unless something is done. Now, there is major concern on the impact and toll on our lives due to air pollution.  
              There are two types of air pollution – indoor and outdoor environment.  Air pollution is defined as the emission of harmful substances to the atmosphere (Ritchie 2015). These pollutants include sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ozone (O3), particulate matter (small suspended particles of varying sizes), carbon monoxide (CO), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) (Ritchie, 2015).  As evident, CO2 is not included in this list as it is not considered within this specific category and inside is viewed separately with other greenhouse gases. When these pollutants, as listed above, merge, the outcome is unpredictable and could be hazardous. For example, SO2 and No2, can react in the Earth’s atmosphere to form particulate matter (PM) compounds (Ritchie 2014). Air pollution thus has a multitude of negative impacts that not only human life pay a price for, but air pollution also damages ecosystems, and crops.  Air pollution contributes to more than 20,000 deaths a year (Bakalar, 2017). The worst part is that this number keeps increasing and will continue to increase until greater action is taken. Researchers believe that for every day-to-day increase of 10 micrograms per cubic meter in fine particulate matter (PM 2.5), there was a 1.05 percent increase in deaths (Bakalar, 2017).
              In children, the toll from air pollution is even more significant. The Unicef Organization was able to measure using satellite data that about 90 percent of the world’s children, approximately 2 billion, live in places where the air pollution outside exceeds World Health Organization (WHO) limits (Carrington, 2016). This has contributed to 600,000 child deaths a year, which researchers believe are caused from malaria and HIV combined – both attributed to air pollution (Carrington, 2016).  All countries must take some strides to mitigate the effects of air pollution. However, these 10 countries in Figure 1 show that China, United States, European Union, India, Russian Federation, Indonesia, Brazil, Japan, Canada, and Mexico are the top 10 emitters of global GHG emissions, and these countries alone produce around 70 percent of the global emissions (Ge, 2014). There are two ways to show emissions – cumulatively and annually. Cumulative emissions describe the total historic emissions of a country. This is used to see which countries are to blame for climate change. The start date is the one that varies but usually starts around when this data could have been measured. In Figure 2, one can see that almost half of the emissions come from just four countries: United States, China, European Union, and Russian Federation (Ge, 2014). This data of GHG Emissions has only been readily available since the 1990s. Before that, data was measured in CO2 emissions. As you can see in Figure 3, the five major emitters are United States, European Union, China, Russian Federation, and Japan, and they contribute a total of two-thirds of the world’s historic CO2 emissions, using around 37 percent of the global carbon budget (Ge, 2014).  
              More action is truly necessary, and that is why I am creating a device to battle the first step of this issue – a better way of monitoring. People, in the east and west, all have something in common. This commonality is technology. We all carry around a piece of this technology in our pockets constantly. Thus, the easiest way to get live data is quite obvious. Smartphones are the answer. We can have a miniature air pollution sensor in our phone cases that monitors the location as well as the air pollution. This will slowly create a map of air pollution throughout the world. By knowing where the problem is coming from, efforts can be taken to stop the problem from the source. 
              
               <br>
              FIGURE 4. THE LOGIC DIAGRAM<br>
              From the logic diagram in Figure 3, there will be millions of monitoring devices in the cases or on phones that people take with them everywhere. This data will be then sent to a database where everything – graphs, charts, raw data – are constantly being updated live. This data could be readily available in a data center, which could be organized from there and analyzed. This data analysis must be shared with countries all around to truly have an effect. Then finally, this is where solutions start to happen. For example, if China is producing triple the amount of CO2 emissions as other countries, countries like US could help them find more clean energy ways to minimize these CO2 emissions.  From the perspective of my project, I will be learning how to build this device using an Arduino and other sensors compatible with it. I will do more research to find the minimum number of gases I can measure to truly represent air pollution. Having an idea of what I will be using will help me guide my future steps in my Smart Pollution Buddy endeavor.
              <h2 class="section-heading">STEP 2 – PROJECT PLANNING AND LEARNING:</h2>
              Hardware Diagram:
              
              
              
              
              
              
              
              
              
              As part of the hardware aspect of my project, I will be using an Arduino. With the Arduino I will be using several components compatible with the Arduino. The big picture starts from the idea of the Internet of Things (Iot). The Internet of Things (IoT) is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals or people that are provided with unique identifiers and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction (Rouse, 2014). This concept of IoT is where all these other devices can exist. The Arduino used will have several components connected to it. I will have 2 or 3 gas sensors to measure different pollutants/air particles. I will also have a wifi module with these sensors because I would like to eventually try to create a way to publish the data recorded. This can be seen in the next diagram. 
               
              FIGURE 6. STATE DIAGRAM FOR WIFI COMPONENT
              Figure 6 shows a couple possibilities in the publishing aspect of the project. I can connect the Arduino to a webpage or an app with a Wifi module such as the CC3000. This will be helpful in documenting data as well as representing it.
              FIGURE 7. PSEUDO CODE DIAGRAM<br>
              Figure 7 shows a very basic outline of the various states that the pollution sensor will enter. The Arduino will first have to successfully connect to the internet in order for it to work. This may be an issue if there is no internet, or if the internet is not working. I should create a back end to still be able to make this work  in the case that there is not a good internet connection. This program represents pseudo code which is the logic of code without the actual syntax, as this can be implemented later. I will also have to keep updating this outline as I find issues with the logic or if I want to add more features. 
              <h2 class="section-heading">STEP 3 – CODING AND BUILDING:</h2><br>
              This step in my research project is where the building happens. Figure 7 shows a code snip-it that connects the sensor to the lcd. This allows us to see how the two components communicate – the MQ-135 and the LCD Display Module with the IIC/I2C adapter. At the top of Figure 7, a library is being installed with the line “#install <LiquidCrystal_I2C.h>”. This library has many useful items that allows us to test and use this LCD Display Module with the code for it to function already written. These libraries can be found in many open source code sharing websites such as github or the Arduino software itself. The next few lines of code are simply making a few variables that will be used later. After this, we must initialize the lcd display to communicate with the Arduino that we want to use it. The rest of the code are essentially print statements that print values on the LCD. There is a section of conditionals.
               <br>
              FIGURE 7 – CODE SNIP-IT FOR SMART POLLUTION DEVICE
              <br>
              LIQUID CRYSTAL LCD <br>
              A liquid crystal display (LCD) is a flat panel electronic visual display that uses a two-dimensional array of liquid crystal (LC) cells, each of which can be electrically controlled to modulate the transmission of light for the display of digital images (Author, date). The LCD display is the dominant form of display due to its desirable features: flat panel, light weight, low driving voltage, low power consumption, high resolution, large viewing angle, high color quality, and availability in a large range of screen size. 
              <br>
              <h2 class="section-heading">STEP 4 – THE VISUAL:</h2><br>
               <br>
              As an aid in the presentation process, I will be presenting a webpage which is connected to the air pollution reader. This will allow for the data to be viewed in an easy to read way. Below is how the website looks in Figure 9. It contains graphs and values. The code used to create this website is in Figure 10. This is called HTML code. HTML is all the words and headings on the page while CSS is what adds color and formats it however you would like.
               <br>
              FIGURE 9 – WEBPAGE <br>
              Figure 9 shows the various components that one may want to see. Air pollution is something that must be monitored in order for it to be fixed. This device will only monitor a few gases. The EPA states that the most injurious pollutants are Carbon Monoxide (CO), Lead (Pb), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Ozone (O3), Particulate matter (PM), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) (EPA, 2014). Figure 10 contains the code for this page.
               <br>
              FIGURE 10 – CODE FOR WEBPAGE
              <br>
              <h2 class="section-heading">STEP 5 – DOCUMENTATION OF FINAL PROJECT:</h2><br><br>
              I have calibrated my sensor and tested the air quality outside and inside and it seems to be correct. I have checked with historic values in databases online and it is about the same. To mimic a highly polluted environment, I put some CO2 coming from a lit match stick next to the sensor and the levels spiked up. Another way to test this, is to just breathe in the box as we exhale CO2. This will temporarily show the levels increase. It is not possible to send this product to other places/countries so I used online data as test data to put into my database.
              ESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT<br>
              The cost of my product is about $45. However, I used only one sensor as this represents a minimal viable product. This cost is calculated with the inclusion of the main components such as the Arduino, MQ-135 sensor, and the wifi module. This cost does not include the less significant items such as wires/resistors, small LED lights, and the 3D print of the box. 
              LEGAL CHALLENGES<br>
              Many applications in the world have been accused of stealing sensitive data such as user location without permission. This is a challenge I will encounter as this is not legal without permission. At a large scale, this product will be condensed to fit in the cases of phones. To solve this issue, I must make an agreement that gives the device permission to use user location in order to achieve retrieve pollution and location data. 
              <br>
              <h2 class="section-heading">STEP 6 – CONCLUSION:</h2><br>
              <br>
              We have a major problem in our world which has prevented our earth to be the same as how it was many years ago. This issue has caused increased health issues in many areas. This issue is air pollution. The Smart Pollution Buddy I have created will not fix pollution all together but will bring us one step closer to doing so. The device will be able to measure the levels of different hazardous gasses in the air and send this to a database which will collect data from all over the world. This will essentially create a God’s eye of air pollution. Just like how google maps measures traffic through satellite, we would be able to have a live map of the air pollution in our world. This data then can be analyzed through predictive maintenance to analyze the causes of the high pollution in certain areas. Then efforts can be made to reduce some of these contributors. This process will not happen overnight, but it will surely make a difference in the long run.
